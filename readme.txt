You probably made mistake on your custom css code. For example, when trying to change main menu color, usually you will use this css code, 
.main-menu-container a{ color: red; } , It's now working, because the coreect way to do it is, .main-menu-container .main-menu-navigation ul li a{ color: red; }. Please check theme css / html class structure to make sure your custom css working properly.
